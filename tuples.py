#tuples--> structure where multiple pieces of data can be stored
#tuples are immutable. Can't be modified

#difference between list and tuple:
# 1) Lists can be modified while tuples can't be modified
# 2) Elements in lists are in [] while elements in tuples are in ()

#how to create a tuple
coordinates = [(4,5), (6,7), (10,11)] #we use the parenthesis. we have created a list and inside it we have created tuples

#trying to change will result in error
#coordinates[1] = 10 ...the error will be: "object does not support item assignment" . this shows its immutability

print(coordinates[0]) #accessing element in the tuple
